# landing-page
This is gonna be my first landing page consisting of following methods: 

Problems encountered:
- unorganized css/html file (too many different classes)
- when flex properties work and when they don't
- a whole lot of containers

Improvements / notes for the future:
- minimize css file, look for combining classes or combine slectors for classes that share same properties -> revisit code!
- overall a solid understanding of the basics of flexbox at least for right now
